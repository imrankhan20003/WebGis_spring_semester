<p style="color:white ;" > <b> being taught at home, Jinnah <a href="https://pakistanpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Muhammad-Ali-Jinnah-Pakistan.jpg"> Jinnah</a> was sent in 1887 to the Sind Madrasat al-Islam (now Sindh Madressatul Islam University) in Karachi.</b> <i> he attended the Christian Missionary Society High School (also in Karachi), where at the age of 16 he passed the matriculation examination of the University of Bombay (now University of Mumbai, in Mumbai, India). On the advice of an English friend, his father decided to send him to England to acquire business experience. Jinnah, however, had made up his mind to become a barrister. In keeping with the custom of the time, his parents arranged for an early marriage for him before he left for England.

    In London he joined Lincoln’s Inn,<strong> one of the legal societies </strong>that prepared<mark> students for the</mark> bar.</i><u> In 1895, at the age of 19,he was called to the bar.<br While in London Jinnah suffered two severe bereavements—the deaths of his wife and his mother. Nevertheless, he completed his formal studies and also made a study of the British political system, frequently visiting the House of Commons. He was greatly influenced by the liberalism of William E. Gladstone, who had become prime minister for the fourth time in 1892, the year of Jinnah’s arrival in London. Jinnah also took a keen interest in the affairs of India and in Indian students. When the Parsi leader Dadabhai Naoroji, a leading Indian nationalist, ran for the British Parliament, Jinnah and other Indian students worked day and night for him. Their efforts were crowned with success: Naoroji became the first Indian to sit in the House of Commons.

    
    When Jinnah returned to Karachi in 1896, he found that his father’s <del>had suffered losses </del>and that<small>had suffered losses  he now had to depend on himself.</u> He decided to start his legal practice in Bombay (now Mumbai), but it took him years of work to establish himself as a lawyer.</p>

<br>Jinnah's moderate faction in the Congress was undermined by the deaths of Mehta and Gokhale in 1915; 
he was further isolated by the fact that Naoroji was in London, where he remained until his death in 1917. Nevertheless, Jinnah worked to bring the Congress and League together. In 1916, with Jinnah now president of the Muslim League, the two organisations signed the Lucknow Pact, setting quotas for Muslim and Hindu representation in the various provinces. Although the pact was never fully implemented, its signing ushered in a period of co-operation between the Congress and the League.[64][52]

<b style="color: white;"> the war, <blockquote>[] joined other Indian moderates in supporting the British war effort, hoping that Indians would be rewarded with political freedoms.
 Jinnah played an important role in the founding of the All India Home Rule League in 1916. Along with political leaders Annie Besant and Tilak,</blockquote > Jinnah demanded "home rule" 
 for India—the status of a self-governing dominion in the Empire similar to Canada,<!---Muhammad-Ali-Jinnah-Pakistan---> New Zealand and Australia, although, with the war, Britain's politicians were not interested in considering Indian constitutional reform. 
 British Cabinet minister Edwin Montagu recalled Jinnah in his memoirs, "young, perfectly mannered, impressive-looking, armed to the teeth with dialectics, and insistent on the whole of his scheme".
In 1918, Jinnah married his second wife Rattanbai Petit</b> ("Ruttie"), 24 years his junior. She was the fashionable young daughter of his friend Sir Dinshaw Petit, and was part of an elite Parsi family of Bombay.[31] There was great opposition to the marriage from Rattanbai's family and the Parsi community, as well as from some Muslim religious leaders. Rattanbai defied her family and nominally converted to Islam, adopting (though never using) the name Maryam Jinnah, resulting in a permanent estrangement from her family and Parsi society. The couple resided at South Court Mansion in Bombay, and frequently travelled across India and Europe. The couple's only child, daughter Dina, was born on 15 August 1919.[31] The couple separated prior to Ruttie's death in 1929, and subsequently Jinnah's sister Fatima looked after him and his child.[66]
